### What is Machine Learning? 
###  Answer: From Wiki(the Term ML was used 1959 by Arthur Samuel), Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML is part of AI.  Applications on Machine Learning: Medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision...Machine Learning is referred as Predictive Analytics.

## Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification  
(According to Prof. Andrew NG,  99% of economic values produced today by Machine Learning is Supervised ML)

* #### Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from
* #### Examples: input x-> output y->Application: Email->Spam( 0/1)-> Eamil Spam Filter; Audio->Text Transcript->Speech Recognition; English->Spanish(Chinese etc)->Mechine Translation; Ad, User info->Click( 0/1)-> Online Advertising;  image radar info-> positions of other cars->Self Driving cars; Image of phones->Defect( 0/1)->Visual inspection

### Regression( dealing with numerical data, to predict a number): Using the provided dataset, the learning algorithm is trying to produce a right answer (y) on different inputs( x). Regression analysis is a statistical technique for determining the relationship between a single dependent (criterion) variable and one or more independent (predictor) variables.
* #### Examples for regression: this housing price prediction is the particular type of supervised learning called regression. By regression, the learning algorithm is  trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers such as the house prices. 
* #### Types of Regression: 
* #### Visualization for regression: Regression line, curve

###  Classification( a predctive modeling to analyze categorical data not numerical data):
